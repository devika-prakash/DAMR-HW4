0,"Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth."
1,"Like most insects, beetles inhale air, for the oxygen it contains, and exhale carbon dioxide, via a tracheal system."
2,This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.
3,The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hind wings to move for flight.
4,Such a bubble may be contained under the elytra or against the body by specialized hydrophobic hairs.
5,"Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests."
6,"The name of the taxonomic order, Coleoptera, comes from the Greek koleopteros (xcexbaxcexbfxcexbbxcexb5xcfx8cxcfx80xcfx84xcexb5xcfx81xcexbfxcfx82), given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra, hardened shield-like forewings, from koleos, sheath, and pteron, wing."
7,"These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families."
8,"The four estimates made use of host-specificity relationships (1.5 to 1.9 million), ratios with other taxa (0.9 to 1.2 million), plant:beetle ratios (1.2 to 1.3), and extrapolations based on body size by year of description (1.7 to 2.1 million).Beetles are found in nearly all habitats, including freshwater and coastal habitats, wherever vegetative foliage is found, from trees and their bark to flowers, leaves, and underground near roots - even inside plants in galls, in every plant tissue, including dead or decaying ones."
9,"Antennae may be clubbed, threadlike, angled, shaped like a string of beads, comb-like (either on one side or both, bipectinate), or toothed."
